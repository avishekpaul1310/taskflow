## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone. We expect all contributors to:

- Be respectful and considerate in communication
- Accept constructive criticism graciously
- Focus on what's best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine
3. **Set up the development environment** (see below)
4. **Create a new branch** for your contribution
5. Make your changes and commit them with clear messages
6. Push your branch to your forked repository
7. Create a pull request to the main repository

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Digital_Kanban_Board.git
cd Digital_Kanban_Board

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (for admin access)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run the development server
python manage.py runserver
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Contribution Process

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your contribution is already being worked on or has been discussed
2. **Create or claim an issue** before starting work on significant changes
3. **Pull the latest changes** from the main branch before starting work
4. **Create a feature branch** with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-task-filtering`)
5. **Make focused changes** that address the specific issue
6. **Write tests** for your changes (if applicable)
7. **Update documentation** as needed
8. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of the changes

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request:

1. **Reference the related issue** in the PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123")
2. **Provide a clear description** of what the changes do and why they're needed
3. **Include screenshots** for UI changes
4. **Ensure all tests pass** and add new tests as appropriate
5. **Keep the scope focused** - if you find other issues, create separate PRs
6. **Be responsive** to feedback and be willing to make changes if requested

## Coding Standards

We follow standard conventions for Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guide

### Style Guides

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Write comments for complex code sections
- Keep functions small and focused
- Maintain consistent whitespace and indentation

## Testing

We value tests that ensure the application works correctly:

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration tests**: Test how components work together
- **UI tests**: Test user interfaces (if applicable)

To run tests:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Documentation

Good documentation is essential for a successful project:
